1 Hour, 
I was a musician, I am a musician, and I will be a musician. So I thought, why not make a music related project. Because at heart, inside of me, that is my most beloved and dear thing to me.
In this first hour, I knew I wanted to level up my guitar equipment one way or another but the question was... HOWWWW?!?!?!??! I started off by wanting to make a guitar pedal, but idea flew away at the end of the first hour when I was staring at my old acoustic guitar that has not 
been touched for 10 years. So the goal is now to make my acoustic guitar into an electric one. Lets see what happens next.

1hr 
I was watching youtube shorts until I saw a video of one of my favourite guitarists named Flawed Mangoes play a live version of one of his audios which required a kill switch to be installed to his guitar. 
Thus giving me my full fledged design idea.

2 Hours,
Researching how I can do this, what parts will I need. I made a list of potential components. Which included a kill switch(any button) a (piezoeletric), 150k ohm resistor and so on.

4 Hours,
I spent time designing up a wiring diagram with my components and rethinking the logic I would use.  I used my chatgpt 4 0 uses to bounce back ideas to understand functionalities and if everythink will actually work. And formed a proper schematic of my design.

4 Hours,
If you look at the img above you will notice some errors. Thought about how to get around the problem and realized that this problem was not a problem at all. and my circuit will work as a passive circuit. and will be powered from the amplifier.. So I just added them to exclusion
